# Genetic Algorithm: Mario's Tuxedo Adventure

The Genetic Algorithm is a heuristic algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. It is commonly used to solve optimization problems by searching for the best solution among a large set of possible solutions.

In this final project, we have decided to implement the Genetic Algorithm on a Mario Bros game. The first step is developing the game itself. Once the game is ready, the Genetic Algorithm will be used to optimize the gameplay. The algorithm will be used to find the optimal path for Mario to complete each level.

The algorithm will work by generating a population of possible solutions, evaluating their fitness, and then selecting the best individuals for reproduction. This process will continue until an optimal solution is found.

By using the Genetic Algorithm, you will be able to improve the gameplay experience for the player. This project will showcase the power of heuristic algorithms in solving complex optimization problems.

The game will adopt the concept of the original super mario bros game, our game will come with a theme that is quite different from the original game. We call it "Mario's Tuxedo Adventure" where Mario will wear a tuxedo and go on an elegant adventure.

In conclusion, implementing the Genetic Algorithm on a Mario Bros is an exciting and challenging project that will help us develop our skills in game development, optimization, and algorithm design.
